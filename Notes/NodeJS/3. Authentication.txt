Authentication in Node.js involves verifying the identity of a user or service to ensure secure access to a system or application. 
This process can be implemented in various ways, using different libraries and strategies depending on the requirements of the 
application. Below are some common methods and tools used for authentication in Node.js:

1. Using Passport.js
2. Using JWT(JSON Web Token)
3. OAuth 2.0 

Authentication patterns in web applications are generally classified into two main categories: stateful and stateless. Each approach 
has its own advantages and trade-offs. Here’s an in-depth look at these patterns:

### Stateful Authentication

Stateful authentication involves storing the user’s session information on the server side. When a user logs in, the server creates a 
session and stores session data in a data store (e.g., a database or in-memory store like Redis). The server then sends a session 
identifier (often a cookie) to the client, which the client includes in subsequent requests to authenticate.

**Key Features:**

1. **Session Management:** The server keeps track of user sessions.
2. **Cookies:** Session ID is usually stored in cookies.
3. **Centralized Control:** Server can easily invalidate sessions.
4. **Scalability Concerns:** Managing sessions can be challenging as the application scales horizontally.

**Implementation Example:**

Using Express and `express-session`:

**Installation:**
npm install express express-session

**Setup:**
const express = require('express');
const session = require('express-session');

const app = express();

app.use(session({
  secret: 'your_secret_key',
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: true,
  cookie: { secure: false } // Should be true in production with HTTPS
}));

app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
  // Authenticate user
  req.session.userId = user.id; // Store user ID in session
  res.send('Logged in');
});

app.get('/profile', (req, res) => {
  if (!req.session.userId) {
    return res.status(401).send('Not authenticated');
  }
  res.send(`Hello User ${req.session.userId}`);
});

app.post('/logout', (req, res) => {
  req.session.destroy(err => {
    if (err) {
      return res.status(500).send('Logout failed');
    }
    res.send('Logged out');
  });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000');
});

### Stateless Authentication

Stateless authentication, on the other hand, does not rely on the server storing any session data. Instead, all the necessary information 
is stored on the client side, typically in the form of a JSON Web Token (JWT). When the user logs in, the server issues a token that is 
then used by the client to authenticate subsequent requests.

**Key Features:**

1. **No Server-Side State:** The server doesn’t store user session data.
2. **Tokens:** Authentication information is embedded in tokens (e.g., JWTs).
3. **Decentralized Control:** Each request is self-contained with its authentication info.
4. **Scalability:** Easier to scale as no session management is needed.

**Implementation Example:**

Using Express and `jsonwebtoken`:

**Installation:**
npm install express jsonwebtoken bcryptjs

**Setup:**
const express = require('express');
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const bcrypt = require('bcryptjs');

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

const users = []; // This should be your user storage, e.g., database

const SECRET_KEY = 'your_secret_key';

app.post('/register', async (req, res) => {
  const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(req.body.password, 10);
  const user = { username: req.body.username, password: hashedPassword };
  users.push(user);
  res.status(201).send('User registered');
});

app.post('/login', async (req, res) => {
  const user = users.find(u => u.username === req.body.username);
  if (!user || !await bcrypt.compare(req.body.password, user.password)) {
    return res.status(401).send('Invalid credentials');
  }
  const token = jwt.sign({ username: user.username }, SECRET_KEY, { expiresIn: '1h' });
  res.json({ token });
});

function authenticateToken(req, res, next) {
  const authHeader = req.headers['authorization'];
  const token = authHeader && authHeader.split(' ')[1];
  if (!token) return res.sendStatus(401);

  jwt.verify(token, SECRET_KEY, (err, user) => {
    if (err) return res.sendStatus(403);
    req.user = user;
    next();
  });
}

app.get('/profile', authenticateToken, (req, res) => {
  res.send(`Hello ${req.user.username}`);
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000');
});

### Comparing Stateful and Stateless Authentication

**Stateful Authentication:**
- **Pros:**
  - Easier to manage and invalidate sessions.
  - Sessions can store more data securely.
- **Cons:**
  - Scalability issues due to server-side session storage.
  - More complex to implement in distributed systems.

**Stateless Authentication:**
- **Pros:**
  - Scalability benefits due to no server-side session storage.
  - Simpler architecture, especially for microservices.
- **Cons:**
  - Tokens need to be stored securely on the client side.
  - Token revocation is more complex.

### Choosing the Right Approach

The choice between stateful and stateless authentication depends on the specific needs and constraints of your application. For instance:
- **Stateful authentication** might be preferable for applications requiring robust session management and control, such as traditional 
    web applications.
- **Stateless authentication** is ideal for scalable, distributed systems, and modern APIs where each request must be self-contained.

Both patterns can be secure and effective when implemented correctly. The decision often hinges on factors like scalability requirements, 
the complexity of session management, and the architecture of the application.

Authentication in Node.js can be implemented in various ways depending on the needs of your application. Whether you use Passport.js for 
a comprehensive solution with various strategies, JWT for a stateless approach, or OAuth 2.0 for third-party authentication, Node.js offers 
the flexibility to integrate the necessary authentication mechanisms effectively.
