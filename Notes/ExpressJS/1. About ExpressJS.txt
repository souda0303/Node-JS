1. About ExpressJS basic:

Express.js is a popular, minimalist web application framework for Node.js, designed to build web applications and APIs. It is known for its simplicity, flexibility, 
and robust set of features for web and mobile applications. Here's an overview of Express.js:

### Key Features of Express.js

1. **Middleware**: Express uses middleware functions to handle requests. Middleware functions have access to the request and response objects, and can end the 
request-response cycle or call the next middleware function in the stack. This makes it easy to handle tasks such as logging, authentication, and request parsing.

2. **Routing**: Express provides a robust routing mechanism to handle various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and URL paths. You can define routes 
using simple and intuitive syntax.

3. **Template Engines**: Express supports various template engines (e.g., Pug, EJS, Handlebars) to dynamically generate HTML pages on the server side.

4. **Static Files**: You can serve static files such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files using built-in middleware.

5. **Error Handling**: Express has a built-in mechanism for handling errors, allowing developers to define custom error-handling middleware.

6. **Scalability**: Being a minimalist framework, Express is highly scalable. It can be extended with numerous npm packages to add functionalities as needed.

### Basic Usage

To start using Express.js, you need to have Node.js installed. Here's a basic example of setting up an Express application:

1. **Installation**:
   npm install express

2. **Creating a Simple Server**:
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();
   const port = 3000;

   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
     res.send('Hello World!');
   });

   app.listen(port, () => {
     console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
   });
   ```
